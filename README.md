# Terraform Cloud Demo Repository

Welcome to the **Terraform Cloud Demo Repository**! This repository demonstrates how to use **Terraform Cloud** to provision AWS infrastructure efficiently and securely.

## Benefits of Terraform Cloud:
- [x] Good for larger teams of Cloud Engineers  
- [x] Remote execution of `terraform plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`  
- [x] Integration with VCS  
- [x] Remote state storage  
- [x] Registry for Terraform Modules  
- [x] Notifications via Slack, Email, Webhook  
- [x] Different access levels for users (some deploy one thing, others another)  
- [x] Sentinels â€“ rules for infrastructure provisioning (paid feature)  
- [x] Cost Estimation â€“ allows approximate infrastructure cost evaluation  

## Overview
This Terraform configuration deploys the following AWS resources:
- **VPC** â€“ A dedicated network for your infrastructure.
- **Security Group** â€“ Defines inbound/outbound traffic rules.
- **EC2 Instance** â€“ A virtual machine running with automated setup via user data.
